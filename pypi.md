# Description
Scientific computing requires handling large composed or structured matrices.
Fastmat is a framework for handling large composed or structured matrices.
It allows expressing and using them in a mathematically intuitive way while
storing and handling them internally in an efficient way. This approach allows
huge savings in computational time and memory requirements compared to using
dense matrix representations. Follow the development on the [github](https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat) project page. The documentation can be found at [readthedocs](https://fastmat.readthedocs.io/).
