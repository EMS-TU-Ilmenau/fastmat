Introduction
------------

.. automodule:: fastmat


Publications
------------

Since we created a package for scientific computing, it makes sense to use it for science. Below we list all publications, which make use of our package with varying degree. If made use of fastmat in your publication, we are happy to reference it here:

    - The White Paper: `Fast Linear Transforms in Python <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09578>`_
    - `Defect Detection from 3D Ultrasonic Measurements Using Matrix-free Sparse Recovery Algorithms <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327768393_Defect_Detection_from_3D_Ultrasonic_Measurements_Using_Matrix-free_Sparse_Recovery_Algorithms>`_
    - `GPU-accelerated Matrix-Free 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction for Nondestructive Testing <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328476659_GPU-accelerated_Matrix-Free_3D_Ultrasound_Reconstruction_for_Nondestructive_Testing>`_

If you use fastmat in your own work we kindly ask you to cite the above mentioned white paper as an acknowledgement.

Public Appearances
------------------

Sometimes we also get out in the wild and present the package. The talks we held can be found below.

    - EuroScipy 2017 Erlangen: `PDF <https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat/releases/download/0.1/082017euroscipy.pdf>`_, `Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5bLgLGae8>`_


Contributions
-------------

There are many ways you as an individual can contribute. We are happy about feature requests, bug reports and of course contributions in form of additional features. To these ends, please step by at `Github <https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat>`_ where we organize the work on the package.


Affiliations and Credits
------------------------

Currently the project is jointly maintained by Sebastian Semper and Christoph Wagner at the `EMS group <https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/it-ems/>`_ at `TU Ilmenau  <https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/>`_.
