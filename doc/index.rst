Contributions
-------------

There are many ways you as an individual can contribute. We are happy about feature requests, bug reports and of course contributions in form of additional features.


Bugs or Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you found anything is missing in our current implementation or is just plain wrong, we first are very sorry for that! Furthermore, we encourage you to open an `issue <https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat/issues>`_ on Github, where you state your problem or the error and we will get to it as soon as possible.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you hacked away on a new feature for our package, we are happy to see your merge request on `Github <https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat>`_, which explicitly encourages everyone to get their hands dirty!
