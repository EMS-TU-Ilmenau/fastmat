In this section we will show what needs to be done in order to
:ref:`implement<implementation>` a new fastmat class and detail on how to
:ref:`test<testing>` it properly once it is implemented using the built-in
class test system. Further, we show how to evaluate the performance of your
implementation by using the also-built-in :ref:`benchmarking<benchmarking>`
system and give examples on how to :ref:`optimize<optimization>` a given
implementation to improve its performance.
